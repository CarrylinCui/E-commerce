                Our espresso owes its distinctive, full-bodied flavour to our founder, Gerry Ford, who left no stone unturned in his drive to create our signature blend nearly 20 years ago.
                <p></p>
                Tirelessly sourcing, selecting, and tasting combinations of beans from across the coffee-growing world we honed our Classico blend, as it is today. A wonderful, rich flavour with a sweet-spot of boldness and complexity, combined with notes of toasted bread and intense dark chocolate.
